# In progress when now

_Adding a now section that makes things in progress._

## Why:

Previously, we had only the "today" section, but the user didn't know which task was doing.

Now the user know exactly which task it was supposed to be done.

## What:

- Add a now section
- Add a today section
- Any task in the now section have a animation showing progress

## How:

- Change the UI
- We adapt the "category" to "tags" so we can attach multiple tags, such as "TodaySection" tag
- Add a new way to see things properties via extensions while still holding business logic. This is used in the base card to check if the task is in progress or not
