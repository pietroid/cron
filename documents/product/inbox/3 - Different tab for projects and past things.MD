# Different tab for projects and past things

_What it does in one phrase._

## Why:

The main page must not have a ton of content. At the same time, we want to see long term things or notes, or even past things we did.

## What:

After much consideration, the best solution to be simple and satisfactory was to create a new tab only for past things, long term projects, etc. While the main tab evolves to have just simpler and more critical content.

## How:

- Add navigation
- Create a new type of widget such as "Timely" but just for these kinds of things
- Probably the "done" will be in this tab, so we need to change its category
- Challenge: Do we want to have things in both tabs? Maybe we need to evolve the "projects" or "themes" discussion
