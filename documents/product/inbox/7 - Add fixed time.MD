## Add fixed time

_On our way to start managing time effectively this is the first small step to this: the ability to add a pre-programmed fixed time to some thing._

## Why

On past week, it's been often to want to add a fixed time to a task because it depends on other people, for example. Besides, this is a good seed for us to start talking about time management and possibly scheduling tasks for the day.

## What

- Add a small bar below the edit/create bottom sheet
- Ability to add a date/time to a thing when added
- Ability to edit or remove this date/time.
- Doesn't need to send notification right now.
- We can exploit the possibility of moving in progress when it is due.

## How

- Add a small bar that leads to another popup
- Create a structure for popups
- Understand a good UI for the time/date selection
- Add a time to a thing linking a event entity
- Add a foreground and possibly a background (?) task to move the task to in progress when it's due date.
- Add a label to the card that shows the time it's due.
