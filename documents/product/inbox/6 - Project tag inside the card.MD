## Project tag inside the card

_Have a little tag indicating which project/theme this thing belongs to._

## Why

Many times we want a thing to be associated to some theme. It could be a big project or just a buy list. It's useful to have this information right at the sight when on a todo list, for example.

## What

- Introduce a small tag below the thing content
- It has smaller font size because should not be the highlight

## How

- We need to understand if we want a "theme" field inside the things or we just use the parent
- We can have multiple parents for the same thing and just list the parent which is not immediately seen (for example, it doesn't make sense to have the "now" parent to be shown both at the screen and at the tag).
